1. Setting Up
I first created a GitHub repository named python-practice.
I set up the project locally by cloning the repository into my computer using VS Code.
I initialized a Git repository, set the remote origin, and configured Git with my username and email.

2. Organizing the Work
I created separate .py files for each task given, to keep my work organized and easy to read.
Each file contains:
The function to solve the task
Clear comments explaining my thinking and how the function works
Example usage (calling the function) to show it working

3. Writing the Functions
For each problem, I carefully thought about how to solve it step-by-step:
Sum all elements in a list: I used a loop to add each number.
Check if a number is even or odd: I used the modulo operator %.
Compute factorial using a loop: I multiplied numbers from 1 up to n.
Reverse a string: I built a new string by adding characters from the end manually (without slicing).
Factorial (Recursive): I used recursion, where the function calls itself.
Sum of Digits of a Number: I extracted each digit and added it together.

4. Committing Progress
After completing each function, I made separate commits with meaningful messages.
This shows how my work grew over time and helps in tracking my progress.

5. Final Steps
After finishing all tasks, I made sure everything was working correctly.
I pushed my final work to GitHub.
Finally, I shared the GitHub repository link for review.
